# Squaresort
In my squaresort method, I used three loops to sort each row in an ascending order. 

Big-O analysis
As I mentioned before, the algorithm took O(mn^2 + nm^2) running time to finish.
Even when m and n stay the same, the elapsed time for each run varies a lot (Â±10000 in general), the data presented is about the average elapsed time for each run.

Theoretically, 3D plot of t(x,y) = x*y^2 + y*x^2 should look like the following graph.
